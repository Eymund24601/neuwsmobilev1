# DEV LOG INDEX

Read order for fastest context recovery:

1. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-10.txt` (messaging threads/realtime + profile/settings + hosted seed work)
2. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-09.txt` (stabilization + auth/sign-in work)
3. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-06.txt` (migration hardening + Supabase onboarding)
4. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-04.txt` (earlier baseline session)

Notes:
- Prefer newest log first.
- Use `docs/backend_schema.md` as canonical architecture/migration source.
- Use `docs/backend_outline.md` for quick contract mapping.
