# DEV LOG INDEX

Read order for fastest context recovery:

1. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-11.txt` (Quiz Clash random->bot mode + fully playable Puzzles delivery + strict Supabase-only runtime/no mock fallback)
2. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-10.txt` (hosted seed/profile/realtime + performance preload/cache + auth/ui polish + creator-compat fallback addenda)
3. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-09.txt` (stabilization + auth/sign-in work)
4. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-06.txt` (migration hardening + Supabase onboarding)
5. `dev context txt/DEV_LOG_2026-02-04.txt` (earlier baseline session)

Notes:
- Prefer newest log first.
- Use `docs/backend_schema.md` as canonical architecture/migration source.
- Use `docs/backend_outline.md` for quick contract mapping.
