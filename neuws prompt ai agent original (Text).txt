PROMPT FOR AI APP BUILDER

You are designing and building “nEUws” – a Duolingo-meets-NYTimes-meets-Substack-meets-Buzzfeed for Europe.

The brand is “Real stories by real Europeans”:

People across Europe write, read, and discuss news, culture, politics, music, and local life.

The platform runs fast because an internal AI backend helps the editorial team find stories and draft daily content.

But to the user, the focus is humans and community, not “wow, AI”.

Avoid technical implementation details (frameworks, databases). Focus on UX, flows, and features.

1. Vibe & Branding

Core identity:

“A European club where you actually understand what’s going on – from people who live it.”

Human, warm, curious. Less “AI startup”, more “magazine + community + games”.

Visual style:

Clean, modern, playful like Duolingo/NYT Games, but with more faces, bylines, and cities.

Country tags and subtle flag accents.

Absolutely do not cover the interface in “AI” labels.

The internal automation is for speed and quality for the editorial team, not a marketing gimmick.

2. Product Pillars

Design the app around these pillars:

Daily European Briefing

Curated stories from every European country.

Mix of short news, longer explainers, and personal perspectives.

Creator Economy

Ordinary Europeans can write high-quality articles, quizzes, and videos.

They can earn money from supporter funds and premium users.

Platform gently encourages “if you know something, teach/explain it.”

Learn Europe

Short learning tracks on history, politics, culture, and music.

Daily games & quizzes inspired by NYT-style puzzles.

Local Perks

Discounts on European brands.

Invitations to local events and meetups.

Multilingual Access

People can read and learn across borders thanks to built-in translation.

Behind the scenes, an AI backend:

Helps the internal editorial team scan online sources daily.

Drafts structured briefs and explainer outlines.

Suggests quiz questions.
But the UI talks about “editorial team” and “community”, not “AI”.

3. Free vs Premium – Value Logic
Feature	Free (“Value Free”)	Premium (“Value Premium” – €7.99/mo)
News from every European country	Yes	Yes
In-depth analysis / debates	2 per day	Unlimited
Daily games & quizzes	2 games per day	Unlimited + harder modes + special series
Learning tracks (history, politics etc.)	Basic access, some steps locked	Full access, deep dives
Discounts on European brands	Some deals	More / better deals, premium-only offers
Write & earn	Allowed, lower visibility / basic earning tier	Boosted visibility, better earning tier
Like / dislike / comment / save folders	Yes	Yes + smart folders / recommendations
Local events	See some events	Priority invites, extra details
Translation features	Translate articles & UI between languages	Same + richer learning modes (e.g. side-by-side reading)
Visual treatment	Light upsell and soft limits	Ad-free, a few premium design touches

All screens must respect these differences (locks, counters, soft paywalls).

4. Core Objects & How They Feel
4.1 Article

Types:

News brief – short, factual “what happened”.

Explainer / debate – gives context, why it matters.

Personal story / essay – very “real person in Europe” vibe.

Fields and UX elements:

Title, country, topic, reading time, difficulty.

Author focus: avatar, short bio, country, maybe “first-time writer” badge.

Clear separation between:

Community pieces (creators).

Editorial pieces (team, assisted by internal AI).

Actions:

Like / dislike (tunes the feed).

Comment thread.

Save to folders.

Share.

Translation UX (important but not flashy):

Small, friendly controls:

“Read in English” / “Read in original [Language]”.

“Translated from [Language]” note – calm, not a flex.

Long-press / highlight text → show translation + simpler explanation.

Avoid big “AI generated” badges. If needed, editorial content can be tagged as “Editorial team”.

4.2 Creator Content (Articles, Quizzes, Videos)

Treat creators as the heart of the brand:

Each creator has:

Profile page with bio, country, topics they cover.

Stats: views, likes, saves, earnings estimate.

Creation flows:

Write article – templates for news, explainer, or personal story.

Create quiz/game – based on their own article or topic.

Upload short video – a quick explainer, tied to an article/topic.

Internally, you may use AI tools to help creators (suggest titles, outline, etc.), but user-facing copy should emphasize:

“We help you structure your ideas”

“Writing helpers” / “Suggestions”
Not “AI this, AI that”.

4.3 Games & Quizzes

NYT-inspired micro-games:

Map/flags, capitals, “connections” groups, timelines, quote guessing, etc.

Each game is tied to:

One or more countries.

An article or learning track step.

Gamification:

XP, streaks, badges.

Daily and weekly challenges (“This week: Balkans week / EU elections special”).

Some games are auto-derived from content (internally via AI), but outward messaging:

“Today’s games based on stories from around Europe.”

4.4 Learning Tracks

Short series like:

“How the EU actually works.”

“Modern Polish politics.”

“History of UK–EU relations.”

“Spanish urban music 101.”

Each track combines:

3–10 steps, each step = 1–2 articles + 1 game.

Progress bar, small rewards (badges, XP).

Tracks can be built both by the editorial team and top creators.

4.5 Discounts & Events

Discounts:

Deals from European brands (travel, food, fashion, SaaS, etc.).

Cards with merchant, country, category, amount, “Copy code”.

Events:

Meetups, talks, cultural nights, elections watch parties, etc.

Each event: city, venue, date/time, host, RSVP button.

Texts should be translated to user’s language with small notes like “Description translated from [Language]”.

5. Main Screens & Flows
5.1 Onboarding

Ask:

Country of residence.

Languages (native + ones they’re comfortable reading).

Interests (politics, history, music, tech, business, culture, local life).

Favorite countries to follow.

Explain the promise in human terms, not AI terms:

“Every day you get a short European briefing, games, and the best community stories, tailored to you.”

5.2 Home / Today

Sections:

Today in your Europe

3–6 cards:

One from their country.

One from a favorite country.

One big EU / pan-European topic.

Mix editorial + creator content.

From real people like you

Feed of personal essays, local explainers, and opinion pieces by creators.

Today’s games

Shows how many free games used (e.g. 1/2).

Quick play buttons.

Continue learning

Resume learning track or suggest new one.

Perks & events

1–2 discounts + 1 nearby or topical event.

Translation:

A small language toggle near top (e.g. “Reading in Swedish · change”).

No loud AI branding. The sense should be:

“Curated + community, with translation that just works.”

5.3 Countries Explorer

List / map of European countries.

When choosing a country, show:

Top stories.

Popular creator articles from there.

Learning tracks and games tied to that country.

Language / translation:

Show original headline if applicable, but let user tap “Read in [their language]”.

Tiny “Translated from X” note.

5.4 Article Page

Key elements:

Strong byline and author section (avatar, country, short tagline).

Topic, tags, estimated time.

For complex pieces, a small context box (timeline, key players, basic definitions).

At the end:

Game or quiz related to the article.

Suggested next articles / learning steps.

CTA for readers:

“Save to folder”

“Follow this author”

“Write your own take on this topic”

Translation UX:

Toggle language.

Highlight-to-translate popup.

Option “Make this easier to understand” (simplified version) if you want.

5.5 Games Hub

Dedicated tab:

Daily streak bar.

Categories (Politics, History, Culture, Music, Map, etc.).

Show relationship to stories:

“Based on recent stories from [countries]”.

Free vs premium clearly visible:

Free: “2 plays today, 1 remaining.”

Premium: no limit + “challenge” games.

5.6 Creator Studio

Flow:

Simple entry point: “Earn by explaining your Europe.”

Steps:

Choose type: article / quiz / video explainer.

Fill in basic info: country, topic, language, short pitch.

Writing interface with:

Headline field, sections, guidance prompts.

Optionally, “get suggestions / structure help” (internally backed by AI, but UI just calls it “Writing help”).

Post-publish:

Show performance stats and earnings line.

Articles are auto-translated for readers; creator can see how many readers in each language.

Once again: do not plaster “AI-generated” anywhere; emphasize author + country.

6. Translation Experience

App-wide rules:

Whole app (navigation, settings, tabs) should appear in user’s chosen language.

Articles, comments, event descriptions, and discount details:

Translatable with a tap.

Clearly but gently marked: “Translated from [Language]”.

Important: translation feels like a helpful utility, not a show-off feature.

7. Upgrade & Monetization UX

For free users:

Hit limits naturally:

After 2 in-depth articles: “You’ve reached today’s deep dives. Unlock full access with Premium.”

After 2 games: “You’ve finished your daily games. Premium unlocks unlimited play.”

For premium users:

Highlight:

Unlimited deep dives and games.

Better discounts & earlier event invites.

Better visibility / earnings tier if they are creators.

Tone: friendly, community-first – no aggressive dark patterns.

Overall Goal

Design an app where a European 18–35 year old:

Opens it daily for 5–15 minutes,

Gets a real sense of what people across Europe are living and thinking,

Learns a bit of history/politics/culture through articles and games,

Feels encouraged to share their own perspective and maybe earn,

And can read anything regardless of language thanks to subtle translation features.

Internally, you may use AI to power content discovery, drafting, and translation.
Externally, the brand is about humans, stories, and community, not AI.
